# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description

A simple implementation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. Allows a user/player to play the game against the computer by typing their move into a prompt. The script checks for move validity and re-prompts if the move was not valid until a valid move is entered. Otherwise, generates a random computer move and checks who won. Each game consists of 5 rounds regardless of how many wins the player or computer has. After 5 rounds, the script tells the player if they beat, lost to, or tied the computer. Refreshing the page lets the user play again.

Note: a GUI will be added later.
